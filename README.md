# E-commerce-Delivery-Delay-prediction-Using-Machine-learning

This project predicts the number of days a product delivery might be delayed using real-world e-commerce data from the Olist dataset. We used a Stacking Regressor to combine multiple models for better performance.

# **Dataset**

The dataset used is a merged E-commerce dataset stored in the file:
combined_data.csv
It includes customer, order, product, payment, and delivery-related features such as:
- Order timestamps
- Freight value
- Product weight and volume
- Payment details
- Delivery timelines

# **Model Used**
I trained a Stacking Regressor with the following components:
*Base Models:*
- XGBRegressor (with best parameters from RandomizedSearchCV)
- GradientBoostingRegressor

*Meta Model:*
- LinearRegression

# **Model Performance**
Evaluated on the test data using these metrics:

*Metric	Value*
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error): 4.33 days
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): 7.44 days
- RÂ² Score: 0.4609
The target variable **(delivery_delay)** shows a normal distribution, indicating the model isn't biased and is generalizing fairly well.

# **Streamlit App**
I built a simple interactive Streamlit app where users can input key order details and predict delivery delay in real-time.

- App file: Main.py
- Model file: final_stacked_model.pkl

*Example output from the app:* ðŸšš Predicted Delivery Delay: -6.89 days
Negative delay implies that the product may arrive earlier than expected. ðŸŽ‰
